<h1 class = "Big">THE DIVISION OF ANIMALS</h1>
<h2 class = "Big">PET ANIMALS</h2>
<p class = "Big">A pet, or companion animal, is an animal kept primarily for a person's company or entertainment rather than
as a working animal, livestock or a laboratory animal. Popular pets are often considered to have attractive appearances, 
intelligence and relatable personalities, but some pets may be taken in on an altruistic basis (such as a stray animal) and
accepted by the owner regardless of these characteristics. Two of the most popular pets are dogs and cats.Pets provide their 
owners (or "guardians") both physical and emotional benefits. Walking a dog can provide both the human and the dog with 
exercise, fresh air and social interaction. Pets can give companionship to people who are living alone or elderly adults
who do not have adequate social interaction with other people.</p>
<h2 class = "Big">DOMESTIC ANIMALS</h2>
<p class = "Big">Domesticated animals are animals that have been selectively bred and genetically adapted over generations
 to live alongside humans. They are genetically distinct from their wild ancestors or cousins. They live in herds or had
 ancestors that lived in herds, making them easy for humans to control.  Cows, goats, sheep etc are examples for domestic
animals.  Humans get milk, wool, meat etc. from this domestic animals.  Anyway, Domestication is a gradual process, so there
 is no precise moment in the history of a given species when it can be considered to have become fully domesticated.</p>
<h2 class = "Big">WILD ANIMALS</h2>
<p class = "Big">Wildlife traditionally refers to undomesticated animal species, but has come to include all organisms that 
grow or live wild in an area without being introduced by humans. Wildlife can be found in all ecosystems. Deserts, forests,
 rainforests, plains, grasslands, and other areas, including the most developed urban areas, all have distinct forms of
 wildlife. While the term in popular culture usually refers to animals that are untouched by human factors, most scientists
 agree that much wildlife is affected by human activities.  Humans have historically tended to separate civilization from
 wildlife in a number of ways, including the legal, social, and moral senses.</p>
