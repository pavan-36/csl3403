<h1 class="ad">2006146-ASSIGNMENT-3.2</h1>
<p class="ad sd"> For this question, I have created two classes.</p> 
<p class="ad sd"> One of them is "ad", which will change the color to blue and the other is "sd", which will change the background color to red.</p> 
<p class="ad sd"> The intresting thing is when you use both this classes same time the font style would become italic.</p>
<p class="ad sd"> I have used only ad in h1 tag, only sd in h2 tag and both in the paragraph tag. </p>
<h2 class="sd";>THANK YOU</h2>
